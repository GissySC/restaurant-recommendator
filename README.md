I’m halfway through the TypeScript course on Codecademy and wanted to save the solution to this project since it took me some time to complete.

This program provides a way to filter and display restaurant dishes based on the customer's budget. It pulls data from a list of restaurants and their corresponding menu items, categorized by price brackets (Low, Medium, and High). The program includes the following functionality:

- getMaxPrice: Determines the maximum price a customer is willing to pay based on the restaurant's price bracket.
- getOrders: Filters the dishes for each restaurant to surface those that fit within the customer’s budget.
- printOrders: Displays the name of each restaurant and lists the dishes that match the customer's price range, showing the cost of each dish.
This program is useful for narrowing down menu options and ensuring that only budget-friendly dishes are presented to the customer.
